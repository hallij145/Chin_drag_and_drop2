# Project for CMSC 374 Mobile Apps

In the final version of our project, our goal was to simply implement a sample list of characters to show the experimental "constructive" functionality of the app, as well as the dictionary resource funcionality. Unfortunately, this came at the cost of the titular "drag-and-drop" feature, though compiling and designing a database of Chinese characters that was easily mutable as well as spacialy-efficient quickly took top priority.

In the final app, the following functionality is available:

Clicking two of the green, pre-coded demo radicals in the play screen will return a list of characters associated with (or including) those two radicals. 
By tapping the same demo radical twice, all available characters with that radical will be displayed. 
Long-pressing ANY one radical will provide you with its pronunciation and meaning. 
By long-pressing the resulting character, it will be added to the user-defined dictionary shown on the second tab of the dictionary screen.
